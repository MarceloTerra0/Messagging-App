# Simple-Messagging-App
A simple messagging app that I made (Also using [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to learn about sockets. It's still very primitive and there's still much to be done, however I'm fine with it being this way, since I want to start some other new projects.
